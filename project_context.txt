COMPREHENSIVE PROJECT CONTEXT & RULES FOR FLORILEGIUM-DEV

Hey! I'm working on a reading dashboard called "Florilegium" and need help setting up a new development environment and implementing an A-Z reading challenge feature. Here's everything you need to know:

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
This is a Next.js reading dashboard that processes Goodreads library exports and displays reading statistics, TBR randomizer, pacing calculator, etc. The main project is in `/Users/najaaddayib/florilegium` and I need to copy everything to `/Users/najaaddayib/florilegium-dev` for development.

## CRITICAL RULES - READ THESE FIRST
1. **NEVER suggest starting fresh or reinitializing Git** - I want to preserve my existing Git history
2. **NEVER suggest creating new Vercel projects** - I'll handle deployment myself
3. **ALWAYS ask before making major structural changes** - I have a complex data processing pipeline
4. **DON'T assume you know the "best" way** - ask me what I want to achieve first
5. **If you're confused about something, ASK instead of guessing**
6. **DON'T blindly copy .git files** - they mess up Git history and cause conflicts

## CURRENT PROJECT STRUCTURE

│   └── structured_reading_data.json # Frontend data
└── public/               # Static assets
```

## DATA PROCESSING PIPELINE (CRITICAL)
The system processes Goodreads exports through multiple stages:
1. `clean_data.py` - Basic CSV cleaning
2. `manual_genres.py` - Applies manual genre assignments
3. `google_api_enrich.py` - Adds genres via Google Books API
4. `apply_overrides.py` - Applies book-specific overrides (dates, read counts)
5. `apply_book_genre_overrides.py` - Applies book-specific genre overrides
6. `data_prep.py` - Generates final JSON for frontend

**IMPORTANT**: This pipeline has verification checkpoints to prevent data loss. Don't modify the core logic without understanding the flow.

## CURRENT FEATURES
- Reading statistics dashboard
- TBR (To Be Read) randomizer with genre filtering
- Pacing calculator with dynamic goal setting
- Genre-based book organization
- A-Z book browsing
- Progress tracking

## WHAT I NEED HELP WITH

### 1. COPY PROJECT TO DEV FOLDER
I need to copy the entire project to florilegium-dev but:
- EXCLUDE .git directory (don't want Git conflicts)
- EXCLUDE node_modules (will reinstall)
- Preserve all other files and structure
- Set up new Git repo in dev folder

### 2. A-Z READING CHALLENGE FEATURE
I want to add a new feature where users can:
- Select one book for each letter of the alphabet (A-Z)
- Have a password-protected page for editing selections
- Store the selections persistently
- Display the A-Z challenge progress

**Requirements:**
- Password protection (simple environment variable)
- Only one user (Shannon) can edit
- Persistent storage of A-Z selections
- Integration with existing book data

**Authentication Options I'm Considering:**
- Environment variable password (simple)
- Basic auth middleware
- Session-based auth

**State Management Options:**
- Supabase (preferred - I already have account)
- Vercel KV
- Airtable
- Local JSON file (fallback)

## TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Frontend Stack
- Next.js 14+ with App Router
- React components
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript

### Backend/Data Processing
- Python scripts for data processing
- CSV manipulation with pandas
- Google Books API integration
- JSON output for frontend

### Key Files to Understand
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Main dashboard component
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - App layout
- `scripts/main.py` - Data processing orchestration
- `scripts/data_prep.py` - Core data transformation logic

## WHAT I WANT TO ACHIEVE
1. **Copy project to dev folder** - Safely copy without Git conflicts
2. **Set up the A-Z challenge page** - New route and component
3. **Implement authentication** - Password protection for editing
4. **Set up data storage** - Persistent A-Z selections
5. **Integrate with existing data** - Use current book database
6. **Create editing interface** - For Shannon to manage A-Z selections

## QUESTIONS FOR YOU
1. What's the best way to copy the project excluding .git and node_modules?
2. What's the best approach for simple password authentication in Next.js?
3. Should I use Supabase for storing A-Z selections, or is there a simpler option?
4. How should I structure the A-Z challenge data (JSON schema)?
5. What's the cleanest way to integrate this with the existing codebase?

## IMPORTANT NOTES
- I have a working production version, so don't break anything
- The data processing pipeline is complex and fragile - be careful
- I prefer simple, maintainable solutions over complex ones
- Ask questions if you're unsure about anything
- DON'T blindly copy .git files - they cause conflicts

Please help me figure out the best approach for copying the project and implementing the A-Z challenge feature while being careful not to break the existing functionality!
